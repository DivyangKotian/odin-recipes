    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>List of ingredients
        <li>Cake flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder and baking soda</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Whole milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Any filling you like, eg-Nutella, Red bean paste(anko) etc</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <ol>Making the Batter
         <li>Sift 1¼ cups cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp baking soda into a large bowl.</li>
         <li>Add 3 Tbsp sugar and whisk well to combine.</li>
         <li>n a medium bowl, whisk 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) and then add 200 ml whole milk (¾ cup + 4 tsp). Combine well.</li>
         <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk well. Keep the batter in the refrigerator for at least one hour to rest and let the flour absorb the liquid. Tip: Whisking the batter creates gluten; by letting it rest, the batter will relax and become smooth.
        </li>
         <li>Pour the batter into a measuring cup or jug. You should have about 1¼ cups.</li>   
        </ol>
        <ol>To cook the Taiyaki
            <li>Preheat the taiyaki maker over medium-low heat. When it‘s hot, grease the pan with some of the 1 Tbsp neutral oil using a brush.</li>
            <li>Fill the taiyaki pan mold about 60% full of batter.</li>
            <li>In the center of each mold, put about 1 Tbsp of the 5 Tbsp sweet red bean paste (anko) and pour more batter on top to cover it.</li>
            <li>Optional: You can also use Nutella as a filling.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and immediately flip.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 to 2½ minutes on that side. Then flip and cook for another 2 to 2½ minutes. Open and check to see if the taiyaki is golden brown. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Continue cooking the remaining taiyaki.</li>
